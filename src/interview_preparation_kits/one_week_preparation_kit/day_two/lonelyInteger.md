# Lonely Integer

## Problem

Given an array of integers, where all elements but one occur twice, find the unique element. Return that element.

## Example

```typescript
const a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1] // 4
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= number of elements < 100`
- It is guaranteed that the number of elements is an odd number and that there is one unique element.
- `0 <= a[i] <= 100`, where `0 <= i < n`
