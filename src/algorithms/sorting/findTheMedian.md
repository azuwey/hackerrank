# Find the Median

## Problem

The median of a list of numbers is essentially its middle element after sorting. The same number of elements occur after
it as before. Given a list of numbers with an odd number of elements, return the median.

## Example

```typescript
const arr = [5, 3, 1, 2, 4]
```

The sorted array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. The middle element and the median is `3`.

## Constraints

- `1 <= number of elements <= 1000001`
- The number of elements is always odd
- `-10000 <= arr[i] <= 10000`
